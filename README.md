Button-style controller with a lever: it's just a big D-Pad

Lots of garbage in there, but the main project file is called dpad_layout.blend. Parts to print are:
 - "bed" collection: bottom frame, has a cradle for a Brook PS3/PS4 Fight Board
 - "lever" collection: D-Pad lever - recommend using a 'fine' print setting and printing from the side
 - "lever midframe" collection: print from the flat part, use a 'fine' print setting, snaps the D-Pad onto the case
 - "top case" is the top case: print from the bottom if you want a nice top, but that's a lot of support
 - "USBC female holder": able to hold one end of this cable: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073XKK9MZ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details
 - Key plugs for D-Pad and normal buttons are for a Cherry low-profile switch
